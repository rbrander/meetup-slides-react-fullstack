# ReactJS Meetup slides - Implementing a full-stack react app

To install the dependencies and start the web server:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

To see the slides go to: [localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081)


## Generating a PDF

To generate a PDF of your slides, go to [http://localhost:8081/index.html?print-pdf](http://localhost:8081/index.html?print-pdf). From there, follow the [instructions provided by reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#pdf-export). 

This will produce a more true-to-screen PDF than using the reveal.js `print-pdf` phantomJS script.
